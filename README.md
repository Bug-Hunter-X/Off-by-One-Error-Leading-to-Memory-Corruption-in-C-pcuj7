This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C programming that results in undefined behavior.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version.  The error is related to pointer arithmetic and accessing memory beyond the allocated array bounds.  Always ensure your pointer arithmetic respects array bounds to prevent unexpected issues and potential crashes.  Understanding array bounds is crucial for avoiding memory-related bugs in C.
